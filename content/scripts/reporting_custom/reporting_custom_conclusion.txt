CONCLUSION
There can be no substitute for quality data and information obtained in a timely manner in a format that is ready for analysis.
Accurate data is an essential part of any decision-making process.
Custom reports are a simple solution made available to our clients to address their need to be proactive rather than reactive in a dynamic microlending environment where those behind the curve often donâ€™t survive.
Custom reports give a user access to their data based on their needs and their specific criteria at any given point and as often as they want.
The flexibility of the custom reports design allows users to create both simple to incredibly complex queries using an intuitive interface.
We are confident that the addition of custom reports in Mobiloan will give you the edge that you need to help grow your business.
